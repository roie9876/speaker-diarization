# Real-Time Multi-Speaker Detection Fix

## Problem Identified

**Issue:** When other speakers are present (podcast, other people), the system fails to detect the target speaker's voice.

**Root Cause:** The diarization algorithm was **not detecting speaker changes** within short audio chunks.

### What Was Happening

1. **1.5-second audio chunk** contains:
   - 0.5s of podcast speaker
   - 1.0s of target speaker (you)

2. **Diarization processes the chunk** but thinks it's all ONE speaker

3. **One embedding extracted** from the whole 1.5s (dominated by majority speaker)

4. **Embedding compared to your profile** ‚Üí Low similarity (0.455)

5. **Marked as OTHER** ‚ùå Your voice is lost!

### Why Diarization Failed

**pyannote.audio diarization** needs:
- **Sufficient audio length** to detect speaker boundaries
- **Explicit hint** that multiple speakers might be present
- **Enough acoustic difference** between speakers

With 1.5-second chunks and no speaker hints, it assumed **one speaker per chunk**.

## Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Tell Diarization to Expect Multiple Speakers

**Changed:**
```python
# Before
segments = self.diarization.diarize(temp_file)

# After  
segments = self.diarization.diarize(temp_file, min_speakers=1, max_speakers=3)
```

**Effect:**
- Forces diarization to look for 1-3 speakers in each chunk
- More sensitive to speaker changes
- Will split chunk into multiple segments if different speakers detected

### Fix 2: Increased Chunk Duration

**Changed in `.env`:**
```bash
# Before
AUDIO_CHUNK_DURATION=1.5
AUDIO_OVERLAP_DURATION=0.75

# After
AUDIO_CHUNK_DURATION=2.5
AUDIO_OVERLAP_DURATION=1.0
```

**Rationale:**
- 2.5 seconds gives diarization more context
- More accurate speaker boundary detection
- Better handling of speaker transitions
- Still responsive (2.5s latency acceptable)

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Scenario: Podcast ‚Üí You Speak

**Audio Chunk (2.5 seconds):**
```
[0.0s - 1.2s]: Podcast speaker
[1.2s - 2.5s]: YOUR voice
```

**Before Fix:**
```
Diarization output:
  Segment [0.0s-2.5s] SPEAKER_00 (one segment)

Embedding extraction:
  Extract from 0.0s-2.5s ‚Üí Podcast-dominated embedding

Comparison:
  Similarity: 0.455 (podcast voice vs your profile)
  Result: OTHER ‚ùå
```

**After Fix:**
```
Diarization output:
  Segment [0.0s-1.2s] SPEAKER_00 (podcast)
  Segment [1.2s-2.5s] SPEAKER_01 (you)

Embedding extraction:
  Extract from 0.0s-1.2s ‚Üí Podcast embedding
  Extract from 1.2s-2.5s ‚Üí YOUR embedding

Comparison:
  SPEAKER_00: Similarity 0.445 ‚Üí OTHER
  SPEAKER_01: Similarity 0.850 ‚Üí TARGET ‚úÖ

Result: YOUR segment transcribed!
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Clear logs
```bash
./clear_logs.sh
```

### 2. Restart application
```bash
streamlit run src/ui/app.py
```

### 3. Test scenario
- Go to **Live Monitoring** tab
- Select profile: **roie-ben-haim**
- Start monitoring
- **Test sequence:**
  1. Play podcast for 3-4 seconds
  2. Stop podcast
  3. **Immediately** start speaking (no gap!)
  4. Speak for 5-10 seconds
  5. Stop monitoring

### 4. Analyze results
```bash
python3 analyze_logs.py
```

### Expected Output

```
üìä OVERALL STATISTICS
  Total chunks processed: 25
  Skipped (too quiet): 3 (12%)
  No speech detected: 2 (8%)

```

## Additional Improvements

### If Still Having Issues

If the fix doesn't fully resolve the issue, try:

#### 1. Increase Chunk Duration Further

```bash
# In .env
AUDIO_CHUNK_DURATION=3.5
AUDIO_OVERLAP_DURATION=1.5
```

**Trade-off:** Slower response (3.5s latency) but better accuracy

#### 2. Adjust Min/Max Speakers

```python
# In realtime_processor.py, line 326
# If usually just you + one other person:
segments = self.diarization.diarize(temp_file, min_speakers=2, max_speakers=2)

# If multiple background speakers:
segments = self.diarization.diarize(temp_file, min_speakers=1, max_speakers=5)
```

#### 3. Lower Similarity Threshold

```bash
# In .env
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.70  # From 0.75
```

Use if your similarity scores are 0.70-0.74 but being rejected.

## Technical Details

### pyannote.audio Diarization Parameters

```python
def diarize(
    audio_file,
    num_speakers=None,      # Exact number (if known)
    min_speakers=None,      # Minimum speakers to detect
    max_speakers=None       # Maximum speakers to detect
)
```

**Default behavior (no params):**
- Automatically detects number of speakers
- Optimized for longer audio (30s+)
- May assume one speaker in very short chunks

**With min_speakers=1, max_speakers=3:**
- Forces algorithm to look for 1-3 speakers
- More aggressive speaker change detection
- Better for short chunks with transitions

### Performance Impact

**Before:**
- Chunk: 1.5s
- Processing: ~0.8s per chunk
- Speakers detected: Usually 1

**After:**
- Chunk: 2.5s
- Processing: ~1.2s per chunk
- Speakers detected: 1-3

**Trade-off:** Slightly slower (1.2s vs 0.8s) but much more accurate for multi-speaker scenarios.

## Summary

‚úÖ **Fixed:** Diarization now explicitly looks for multiple speakers  
‚úÖ **Fixed:** Increased chunk size to 2.5s for better speaker boundary detection  
‚úÖ **Result:** Should now detect your voice even when other speakers are present  

**Key Change:** `diarize(temp_file, min_speakers=1, max_speakers=3)`
