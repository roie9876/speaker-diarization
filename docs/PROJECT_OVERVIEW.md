# Project Overview: Speaker Diarization & Selective Transcription System

## Executive Summary

This project delivers an intelligent audio processing system that identifies a specific person's voice in group conversations and transcribes only their speech. The system combines advanced speaker diarization technology (pyannote.audio) with Azure Speech Service to provide selective, accurate transcription capabilities.

## Business Problem

### The Challenge

In multi-speaker conversations and meetings, there's often a need to:
1. Track what a specific person said across multiple recordings
2. Filter out irrelevant conversation from other participants
3. Process large volumes of meeting recordings efficiently
4. Monitor live conversations for specific speaker contributions

### Current Limitations

- Standard transcription services transcribe everyone equally
- Manual review of full transcripts is time-consuming
- No built-in way to identify specific speakers across different recordings
- Difficult to process recordings at scale

### Our Solution

An automated system that:
- **Learns** a target person's voice from reference samples
- **Identifies** when that person speaks in any recording
- **Transcribes** only their contributions
- **Supports** both batch processing and real-time monitoring

## Project Goals

   - Identify target speaker with >90% accuracy
   - Minimize false positives (transcribing wrong person)
   - Handle various acoustic conditions

2. **Selective Transcription**
   - Transcribe only target speaker's speech
   - Preserve timestamps and context
   - Generate clean, readable output

3. **Flexible Processing Modes**
   - Batch mode for processing multiple recordings
   - Live mode for real-time monitoring
   - Easy enrollment of new speaker profiles

4. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Simple enrollment process for reference audio
   - Intuitive batch processing workflow

## Technical Approach

### Core Technologies (v2.0)

1. **pyannote.audio 3.1+**: Speaker diarization and embedding extraction
2. **Azure Speech SDK (Push Stream API)**: Real-time speech-to-text via WebSocket ⚡
3. **Streamlit**: User interface framework
4. **Python 3.10+**: Primary development language
5. **PyTorch**: ML backend (MPS/CUDA/CPU support)

### Architecture Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between diarization, identification, and transcription
2. **Modularity**: Independent components for easy testing and maintenance
3. **Configuration-Driven**: Easy switching between cloud and container deployments
4. **Scalability**: Design for processing multiple files efficiently

### Processing Strategy (v2.0 - Push Stream)

**Three-Stage Pipeline:**

**Stage 1: Speaker Diarization** (pyannote.audio)
- Process audio in 5-second chunks
- Detect speaker boundaries
- Assign speaker labels (SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01, ...)

**Stage 2: Speaker Identification** (pyannote embeddings)
- Extract 512-dimensional embeddings for each segment
- Compare against target speaker profile embedding
- Calculate cosine similarity
- Tag segments as "target" (similarity ≥0.40) or "other"

**Stage 3: Streaming Transcription** ⚡ NEW (Azure Push Stream API)
- Open WebSocket connection to Azure Speech Service
- **Stream target audio directly** to Azure (no file I/O)
- Receive transcription via event callbacks (1-2s latency)
- Display in real-time with timestamps
- **Fallback**: File-based recognition for batch mode

- Very similar voices (twins, mimics) may be challenging
- Overlapping speech may be skipped for safety
- ~~Real-time mode has inherent latency (2-5 seconds)~~ ✅ **Reduced to 1-2 seconds with Push Stream**
- **NEW**: Streaming mode requires active internet connection (cloud Azure)
- **NEW**: File-based fallback has lower accuracy (60-70% vs 90-95% streaming)
