## Problem Analysis

### User Report
Hebrew transcripts showing incorrect text:
```
🎯 [18:15:44] בדיקה שיי חניאו זה אמא שלי. (Confidence: 0.66)
🎯 [18:15:46] זה אימא שלי אני זה השמר פה זה. (Confidence: 0.65)  
🎯 [18:15:49] קיש אני מאוזב. (Confidence: 0.36)
```

### Log Analysis
```
2025-10-22 18:15:48 - confidence=0.36 (LOW)
2025-10-22 18:15:51 - confidence=0.00 (FAILED - many empty results)
2025-10-22 18:15:54 - confidence=0.00 (FAILED)
2025-10-22 18:15:56 - confidence=0.78 (GOOD but rare)
```

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Over-Amplification**: 3x gain causing audio distortion/clipping
2. **Short Segments**: 2.5s segments challenging for Azure with Hebrew
3. **No Audio Preprocessing**: Raw audio sent to Azure without normalization
4. **Background Noise**: No noise reduction applied
5. **Quality Feedback**: No user guidance on improving setup

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Smart Audio Normalization
**File**: `src/processors/realtime_processor.py`

**Old Code** (Line 263-266):
```python
# Amplify the audio signal (boost by 3x to help with quiet microphones)
audio_data = audio_data * 3.0
audio_data = np.clip(audio_data, -1.0, 1.0)
```

**New Code** (Line 263-273):
```python
# Smart audio normalization (preserves quality)
# Only amplify if signal is weak
rms = np.sqrt(np.mean(audio_data**2))
if rms > 0.001:  # Only if there's actual audio
    target_rms = 0.05  # Target RMS level
    gain = min(target_rms / rms, 2.0)  # Max 2x gain
    audio_data = audio_data * gain

# Clip to prevent distortion
audio_data = np.clip(audio_data, -1.0, 1.0)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Dynamic gain based on signal strength
- ✅ Max 2x amplification (was 3x)
- ✅ Target RMS of 0.05 for optimal transcription
- ✅ Prevents over-amplification distortion

### 2. Audio Preprocessing Before Transcription
**File**: `src/services/transcription_service.py`

**Added** (After line 346):
```python
# Audio preprocessing for better transcription quality
# 1. Normalize audio to optimal level
max_val = np.max(np.abs(segment_audio))
if max_val > 0:
    # Normalize to 70% of max to avoid clipping
    segment_audio = segment_audio * (0.7 / max_val)

# 2. Apply simple noise gate (remove very quiet parts)
noise_threshold = 0.01
segment_audio = np.where(np.abs(segment_audio) < noise_threshold, 0, segment_audio)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Consistent audio levels sent to Azure
- ✅ Removes low-level background noise
- ✅ Prevents clipping (70% of max)
- ✅ Improves Azure speech recognition accuracy

### 3. Quality Tips in UI
**File**: `src/ui/live_tab.py`

**Added** (After transcript display):
```python
# Show quality tips if confidence is low
if target_transcripts:
    avg_confidence = sum(t.get('confidence', 0) for t in target_transcripts) / len(target_transcripts)
    if avg_confidence < 0.70:
        with st.expander("💡 Tips to Improve Transcription Quality", expanded=False):
            st.markdown("""
            **Current confidence is low ({:.0f}%). Try these tips:**
            
            1. **🎤 Microphone Position**: 6-12 inches, same as enrollment
            2. **🔊 Speaking Style**: Clear, normal pace, pause between sentences
            3. **🔇 Environment**: Quiet room, reduce background noise
            4. **🎯 Re-create Profile**: 60+ seconds, quality ≥0.80
            5. **🌐 Language**: Hebrew (Israel) for Hebrew speech
            """.format(avg_confidence * 100))
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Auto-shows when confidence <70%
- ✅ Actionable guidance for users
- ✅ Helps identify environmental issues
- ✅ Reminds about profile quality

## Expected Improvements

### Before
- ❌ Confidence: 0.36-0.66 (low/medium)
- ❌ Many failed transcriptions (confidence=0.00)
- ❌ Audio distortion from 3x amplification
- ❌ Hebrew words incorrectly recognized

### After
- ✅ Confidence: Expected 0.70-0.90 (high)
- ✅ Fewer failures (better audio quality)
- ✅ Clean audio (no distortion)
- ✅ More accurate Hebrew recognition

## Additional Recommendations

### For Immediate Improvement

1. **Re-create Speaker Profile**:
   ```
   - Go to Enrollment tab
   - Delete current profile
   - Record NEW profile:
     * 60+ seconds of speech
     * Same microphone/environment as live monitoring
     * Speak clearly and naturally
     * Check quality score ≥0.80
   ```

2. **Optimize Environment**:
   - Close windows (reduce external noise)
   - Turn off fans, AC, appliances
   - Use quiet room
   - Consistent microphone distance (8-10 inches)

3. **Language Verification**:
   - Live Monitoring tab → Language dropdown
   - For Hebrew: Select **"Hebrew (Israel)"**
   - For English: Select **"English (US)"**

4. **Test Speaking Style**:
   - Speak at normal conversational pace
   - Pause 0.5-1 second between sentences
   - Avoid background conversations
   - Don't whisper or shout

### For Advanced Users

If transcription quality still poor after above steps:

1. **Check Microphone Quality**:
   ```bash
   # macOS: Test microphone
   System Settings → Sound → Input
   # Verify input level shows steady bars when speaking
   ```

2. **Try Different Azure Region** (if cloud mode):
   - .env file: Change `AZURE_REGION=eastus` to `westeurope`
   - Western Europe may have better Hebrew models

3. **Increase Chunk Duration** (trade speed for accuracy):
   - .env file: `AUDIO_CHUNK_DURATION=4.0` (was 2.5)
   - Gives Azure longer context
   - Reduces real-time responsiveness

4. **Use Azure Container** (on-premises):
   - Better for consistent latency
   - More control over speech models
   - Requires Docker setup

## Testing Checklist

After restarting app, verify:
- [ ] Transcripts still appearing (system working)
- [ ] Confidence scores improved (>0.70 average)
- [ ] Fewer empty transcriptions
- [ ] Hebrew text more accurate
- [ ] Tips expander appears when confidence low
- [ ] Audio quality tips helpful

---

## Monitoring

### Check Logs for Improvement
```bash
cd "/Users/robenhai/speaker diarization"
tail -100 logs/realtime_debug.log | grep "confidence=" | tail -20
```

**Look for**:
- Confidence values: Should be ≥0.70
- Fewer "confidence=0.00" (failed transcriptions)
- More consistent recognition

### Check UI Metrics
- Confidence scores in green boxes
- Average confidence in statistics
- Tips expander (should hide if >70%)

---

## If Quality Still Poor

### Possible Causes

1. **Microphone Issues**:
   - Built-in Mac mic may be low quality
   - Try external USB microphone or headset
   - Check macOS mic permissions (Terminal access)

2. **Language Model Limitation**:
   - Azure Hebrew models may be less accurate than English
   - Conversational Hebrew harder than scripted speech
   - Background noise more impactful on non-English

3. **Profile Mismatch**:
   - Profile created in different environment
   - Different microphone/position
   - Profile quality too low (<0.80)

4. **Network Latency** (Cloud mode only):
   - Slow internet connection
   - Azure service delays
   - Consider container mode for local processing
