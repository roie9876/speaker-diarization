### � Critical Fixes (v2.0.1 - October 27, 2025)

#### PYANNOTE_EMBEDDING_CACHING_BUG
**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Impact**: CRITICAL - Batch mode completely broken for multi-speaker audio  
**Issue**: All segments in batch processing produced identical embeddings (0.2300 similarity)
- Root cause: pyannote `Inference` API with "segment" parameter was caching results
- All 13 segments had identical L2 norm (579.58) and range ([-0.104, 0.141])
- Made speaker identification impossible in multi-speaker scenarios
**Fix**: Changed `identification_service.py` to manually extract audio segments first
```python
# Before (broken):
embedding = self.inference({"audio": str(file), "segment": {"start": start, "end": end}})

# After (fixed):
audio, sr = load_audio(audio_file)
segment_audio = audio[int(start * sr):int(end * sr)]
embedding = self.inference({"waveform": torch.from_numpy(segment_audio[np.newaxis, :]), "sample_rate": sr})
```
**File**: `src/services/identification_service.py` lines 120-145  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Batch mode now works correctly

#### BATCH_UI_THRESHOLD_BUG
**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Impact**: HIGH - Batch mode failing for user's voice in multi-speaker audio  
**Issue**: Batch tab used hardcoded threshold (0.75, min 0.5), user voice scored 0.43-0.61
- Prevented detection even after lowering .env SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD to 0.35
- Single-speaker files worked (higher similarity), multi-speaker failed
**Fix**: Changed `batch_tab.py` to read threshold from .env config
```python
# Before: threshold = st.slider(min_value=0.5, value=0.75)
# After: threshold = st.slider(min_value=0.3, value=config.similarity_threshold)
```
**File**: `src/ui/batch_tab.py` lines 62-70  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Batch UI now respects .env threshold

#### LIVE_UI_TRANSCRIPT_DELAY_BUG
**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Transcripts missing when stopping live monitoring  
**Issue**: UI only pulled transcripts while `monitoring_active=True`, Azure delayed 2-5s
- User clicks "Stop" → monitoring_active=False → UI stops checking queue
- Transcripts arrive 2-5s later but never displayed
**Fix**: Changed `live_tab.py` to pull from queue even after stopping
```python
# Now pulls transcripts regardless of monitoring_active state
if hasattr(processor, 'ui_transcript_queue'):
    while not processor.ui_transcript_queue.empty():
        # Process transcript
```
**File**: `src/ui/live_tab.py` lines 227-245  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - All transcripts now appear

### �🚀 Major Implementation (v2.0.0)

#### [PUSH_STREAM_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./PUSH_STREAM_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
**Date**: October 22, 2025

**Date**: Mid-development  
**Issue**: File deletion race conditions, buffer size inefficiencies

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why File-Based Approach Failed

**Problem**: File-based recognition inherently limited
1. ❌ Audio degradation from file conversions (float32 → WAV → PCM)
2. ❌ Context loss between 5s chunks (Azure sees disconnected audio)
3. ❌ File I/O overhead (write → read → delete = race conditions)
4. ❌ Buffer delays (accumulate → process → transcribe = 5-8s latency)
5. ❌ Recognition timeout issues (mid-sentence cuts)

**Solution**: Azure Push Stream API
1. ✅ Direct memory streaming (no file conversions)
2. ✅ Continuous WebSocket connection (context preserved)
3. ✅ No file I/O (zero race conditions)
4. ✅ Real-time streaming (1-2s latency)
5. ✅ Event-driven callbacks (no timeout issues)

## 📚 Key Learnings

### What Worked
1. ✅ **pyannote.audio** - Excellent speaker diarization (90%+ accuracy)
2. ✅ **Cosine similarity** - Effective for speaker identification (threshold 0.40)
3. ✅ **Push Stream API** - Same technology as Azure Speech Studio
4. ✅ **Raw audio** - No preprocessing better than normalized/filtered
5. ✅ **Hebrew optimizations** - Dictation mode, continuous language detection

### What Didn't Work
1. ❌ **File-based transcription** - Too many layers of indirection
2. ❌ **Audio preprocessing** - Degraded quality instead of improving
3. ❌ **Aggressive buffering** - Added latency without accuracy gains
4. ❌ **recognize_once** - Timeout issues with longer segments
5. ❌ **Immediate file deletion** - Race conditions with Azure SDK

### Best Practices Discovered
1. ✅ Use streaming APIs for real-time transcription
2. ✅ Trust Azure's built-in audio processing (don't normalize)
3. ✅ Keep audio format consistent (16kHz, 16-bit PCM throughout)
4. ✅ Use event callbacks instead of polling
5. ✅ Test with production-like audio (not clean samples)

## 🛠️ Maintenance Guide

### If Hebrew Accuracy Drops
1. Check similarity threshold (should be 0.40)
2. Verify speaker profile quality (recreate if needed)
3. Ensure streaming mode enabled (`use_streaming = True`)
4. Check Azure region (eastus recommended)

### If Latency Increases
1. Verify GPU/MPS is being used (check logs)
2. Check network connection to Azure
3. Verify streaming mode is active (not file-based fallback)
4. Monitor audio chunk duration (5s optimal)

### If Speaker Detection Fails
1. Check similarity scores in logs (should be >0.40 for target)
2. Recreate speaker profile with 30-60s clean audio
3. Adjust threshold if needed (0.35-0.50 range)
4. Verify diarization is detecting speakers (check segment count)
