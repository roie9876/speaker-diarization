### 🐛 Bug Fixes (v1.x → v2.0)

#### [FIX_MISSING_IS_TARGET_FLAG.md](./FIX_MISSING_IS_TARGET_FLAG.md)

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

#### [FIX_MID_SENTENCE_CUTS.md](./FIX_MID_SENTENCE_CUTS.md)
**Date**: Early development

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED (fully fixed with Push Stream)

#### [FIX_AZURE_RECOGNITION_LOOP.md](./FIX_AZURE_RECOGNITION_LOOP.md)

**Issue**: Azure recognition callbacks continuing after stop, causing duplicates  
**Fix**: Added "stopped" flag, duplicate detection, increased timeouts  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

#### [FIX_DISABLE_AUDIO_PREPROCESSING.md](./FIX_DISABLE_AUDIO_PREPROCESSING.md)
**Date**: Mid-development  
**Issue**: Audio normalization and noise gate degrading transcription quality  
**Fix**: Disabled preprocessing in realtime_processor.py (raw audio better)  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

#### [FIX_BUFFER_DURATION_FILE_CLEANUP.md](./FIX_BUFFER_DURATION_FILE_CLEANUP.md)
**Date**: Mid-development  
**Issue**: File deletion race conditions, buffer size inefficiencies  
**Fix**: Reduced buffer 15s → 8s → 5s, delayed file cleanup  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED (obsolete with Push Stream - no files)

### 🔧 Optimizations

#### [IMPROVE_TRANSCRIPTION_QUALITY.md](./IMPROVE_TRANSCRIPTION_QUALITY.md)
**Date**: Mid-development  
**Issue**: Generic transcription quality improvements needed  
**Improvements**: 
- Increased chunk duration (2.5s → 5.0s)
- Added transcription buffer system
- Optimized Azure silence timeouts
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (superseded by Push Stream)

#### [HEBREW_ACCURACY_OPTIMIZATION.md](./HEBREW_ACCURACY_OPTIMIZATION.md)
**Date**: Mid-development  
**Issue**: Hebrew accuracy stuck at 60-70%  
**Improvements**:
- Dictation mode enabled
- Profanity filter disabled
- Continuous language detection
- Diacritics enabled
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (carried forward to Push Stream)

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why File-Based Approach Failed

**Problem**: File-based recognition inherently limited
1. ❌ Audio degradation from file conversions (float32 → WAV → PCM)
2. ❌ Context loss between 5s chunks (Azure sees disconnected audio)
3. ❌ File I/O overhead (write → read → delete = race conditions)
4. ❌ Buffer delays (accumulate → process → transcribe = 5-8s latency)
5. ❌ Recognition timeout issues (mid-sentence cuts)

**Solution**: Azure Push Stream API
1. ✅ Direct memory streaming (no file conversions)
2. ✅ Continuous WebSocket connection (context preserved)
3. ✅ No file I/O (zero race conditions)
4. ✅ Real-time streaming (1-2s latency)
5. ✅ Event-driven callbacks (no timeout issues)

## 📚 Key Learnings

### What Worked
1. ✅ **pyannote.audio** - Excellent speaker diarization (90%+ accuracy)
2. ✅ **Cosine similarity** - Effective for speaker identification (threshold 0.40)
3. ✅ **Push Stream API** - Same technology as Azure Speech Studio
4. ✅ **Raw audio** - No preprocessing better than normalized/filtered
5. ✅ **Hebrew optimizations** - Dictation mode, continuous language detection

### What Didn't Work
1. ❌ **File-based transcription** - Too many layers of indirection
2. ❌ **Audio preprocessing** - Degraded quality instead of improving
3. ❌ **Aggressive buffering** - Added latency without accuracy gains
4. ❌ **recognize_once** - Timeout issues with longer segments
5. ❌ **Immediate file deletion** - Race conditions with Azure SDK

### Best Practices Discovered
1. ✅ Use streaming APIs for real-time transcription
2. ✅ Trust Azure's built-in audio processing (don't normalize)
3. ✅ Keep audio format consistent (16kHz, 16-bit PCM throughout)
4. ✅ Use event callbacks instead of polling
5. ✅ Test with production-like audio (not clean samples)

## 🛠️ Maintenance Guide

### If Hebrew Accuracy Drops
1. Check similarity threshold (should be 0.40)
2. Verify speaker profile quality (recreate if needed)
3. Ensure streaming mode enabled (`use_streaming = True`)
4. Check Azure region (eastus recommended)

### If Latency Increases
1. Verify GPU/MPS is being used (check logs)
2. Check network connection to Azure
3. Verify streaming mode is active (not file-based fallback)
4. Monitor audio chunk duration (5s optimal)

### If Speaker Detection Fails
1. Check similarity scores in logs (should be >0.40 for target)
2. Recreate speaker profile with 30-60s clean audio
3. Adjust threshold if needed (0.35-0.50 range)
4. Verify diarization is detecting speakers (check segment count)
