# Profile Quality Assessment Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Feature Completed

The Profile Quality Assessment feature has been successfully implemented to help users create high-quality speaker enrollment profiles.

## What Was Added

### 1. Quality Assessment Method (`identification_service.py`)
- New method: `assess_profile_quality(audio_file, embedding, start, end)`
- Evaluates 4 quality factors with weighted scoring
- Returns comprehensive quality report with recommendations

### 2. Profile Storage Enhancement (`profile_manager.py`)
- Profiles now store quality assessment data
- Quality information persisted with speaker profiles
- Accessible for future reference

### 3. Enrollment UI Updates (`enrollment_tab.py`)
- Automatic quality assessment during profile creation
- Visual quality display with metrics and scores
- Component breakdown (Duration, Audio Level, Embedding, SNR)
- Actionable recommendations for improvement
- Quality badges in profile list (✅/✔️/⚠️/❌)

### 4. Documentation (`docs/PROFILE_QUALITY.md`)
- Comprehensive guide to quality assessment
- Best practices for high-quality recordings
- Interpretation of quality scores and labels

### 5. Test Script (`tests/test_profile_quality.py`)
- Standalone test script for quality assessment
- Tests with existing audio files
- Displays detailed quality metrics

## Quality Metrics

### Components (Weighted Scoring)
1. **Duration Score** (25%) - Longer is better (30-60s ideal)
2. **Audio Level Score** (25%) - Good volume without clipping
3. **Embedding Quality** (30%) - Well-formed voice fingerprint
4. **SNR Score** (20%) - Low background noise

### Quality Labels
- **Excellent** (0.80-1.00): ✅ Ready for production
- **Good** (0.65-0.79): ✔️ Works well in most cases
- **Fair** (0.50-0.64): ⚠️ May work, consider improving
- **Poor** (0.00-0.49): ❌ Re-record recommended

## Usage Example

### During Enrollment
```
User uploads 45-second audio file
↓
System extracts embedding
↓
System assesses quality:
  - Duration: 0.95 (45.2s - ideal range)
  - Audio Level: 0.90 (good volume, no clipping)
  - Embedding: 0.85 (well-formed)
  - SNR: 0.80 (low background noise)
  - Overall: 0.87 - ✅ Excellent
↓
System displays:
  "✅ Excellent profile quality - ready for use!"
↓
Profile saved with quality data
```

### In Profile Management
```
Profile List shows:
  ✅ John Doe - Excellent (0.87)
  ✔️ Jane Smith - Good (0.72)
  ⚠️ Bob Jones - Fair (0.58)
```

## Test Results

Test with 3-second low-quality audio:
```
❌ Overall Quality: Poor (0.470)

Components:
• Duration:    0.300 (3.0s - too short)
• Audio Level: 0.300 (RMS too low)
• Embedding:   0.800 (good despite issues)
• SNR:         0.400 (high noise - 1.0 dB)

Recommendations:
⚠️ Audio too short - use 30-60 seconds
⚠️ Audio level too low - speak louder
⚠️ Embedding shows low diversity - ensure clear speech
⚠️ High background noise - find quieter environment
⚠️ Profile quality is low - consider re-recording
```

## User Benefits

1. **Immediate Feedback** - Know if enrollment is successful
2. **Clear Guidance** - Specific recommendations for improvement
3. **Confidence** - Understand profile reliability
4. **Better Results** - Higher quality = better recognition
5. **Time Saving** - Avoid poor profiles that won't work well

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `src/services/identification_service.py` (+194 lines)
   - Added `assess_profile_quality()` method
   - Audio analysis using librosa
   - Embedding validation
   - SNR estimation

2. `src/services/profile_manager.py` (+3 lines)
   - Store quality data in profiles

3. `src/ui/enrollment_tab.py` (+63 lines)
   - Quality display during enrollment
