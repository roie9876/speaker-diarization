## 🤖 How GitHub Copilot Uses This

### Automatic Context
When you work in this repository, Copilot **automatically reads** `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:

```python
# When you type this comment:
# Create a speaker diarization service

# Copilot will suggest code that follows YOUR project structure:
class DiarizationService:
    def __init__(self, use_gpu=True):
        self.device = torch.device("mps" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else "cpu")
        self.pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained("pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1")
        # ... project-specific implementation
```

### Explicit References
You can also reference it directly in chat:

```
@.github/copilot-instructions.md 
Implement the identification service following the project specifications
```

## 📝 When to Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

### ✅ DO UPDATE When:

1. **Completing implementation phases**:
   - Phase 1 done → Update status section
   - New patterns discovered → Add to best practices

2. **Architecture changes**:
   - Different library chosen → Update tech stack
   - New processing approach → Update pipeline diagram

3. **Common issues found**:
   - Bugs fixed → Add to pitfalls section
   - Performance optimizations → Update optimization tips

4. **Project scope changes**:
   - New features added → Update checklist
   - Requirements changed → Update goals

### ❌ DON'T UPDATE For:

- Minor code tweaks
- Bug fixes that don't affect overall approach
- Documentation formatting changes
- Individual function implementations

## 💡 Pro Tips for Working with Copilot

### 1. Use Clear Comments
```python
# Extract 512-dimensional speaker embedding from audio segment using pyannote
def extract_embedding(self, audio_file):
    # Copilot will suggest implementation based on your instructions
```

### 2. Reference Specific Docs
```
# Implement batch processor as specified in .github/copilot-instructions.md Phase 2
```

### 3. Ask for Project-Specific Code
```
# Create Azure Speech Service client supporting both cloud and container endpoints
# as defined in our project configuration
```

### 4. Leverage Examples
```
# Follow the same pattern as DiarizationService but for identification
```
