# Troubleshooting Real-Time Voice Detection

## Quick Start

### 1. Clear Logs
```bash
./clear_logs.sh
```

### 2. Start Application
```bash
streamlit run src/ui/app.py
```

### 3. Test Live Monitoring
- Go to **Live Monitoring** tab
- Select your profile
- Start monitoring
- **Test:** Play podcast ‚Üí Stop ‚Üí Start speaking immediately
- Stop monitoring

### 4. Analyze Results
```bash
python3 analyze_logs.py
```

## What You'll See

The analyzer will show:

- **üìä Statistics**: How many chunks detected target vs other
- **üéØ Similarity Scores**: Your voice vs other speakers
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Problem Chunks**: Where your voice was missed
- **üí° Recommendations**: Threshold adjustments, profile improvements

## Common Solutions

### If your voice is not detected:

**Check similarity scores in analysis:**

```
TARGET Min: 0.685  ‚Üê Below threshold (0.75)
```

**Solution:** Lower threshold in `.env`:
```bash
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.65
```

### If profile quality is low:

**Check in app:** Enrollment ‚Üí Manage Profiles ‚Üí Click your profile

**If Quality Score < 0.75:**
- Re-record profile with 45-60 seconds of clear speech
- Use same microphone/environment as live monitoring
- Reduce background noise during recording
