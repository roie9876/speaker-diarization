# Current Issue Diagnosis

## Test Results (October 22, 2025)

### ✅ What's Working
- Multi-speaker detection (finds 1-2 speakers per chunk)
- Diarization creating separate segments
- Threshold correctly set to 0.50
- Got 2 transcripts (Hebrew text detected!)

### ❌ What's Not Working
- **Your similarity scores: 0.1-0.5** (too low and inconsistent)
- Only 2 out of 40 chunks detected as target (5%)
- Most speech scoring below 0.50 threshold
- Missing most of your speech

## Root Cause

**Profile acoustic mismatch** - Your recorded profile doesn't match your live microphone voice.

### Evidence
- Similarity range: 0.077-0.545
- Average: ~0.25
- Only 2 peaks at 0.533 and 0.545 (barely above threshold)
- Most chunks: 0.1-0.4 (far below threshold)

### Why This Happens
The profile embedding and live voice embeddings are too different. Possible reasons:

1. **Different microphone characteristics** (even though same device)
2. **Different recording conditions** (quiet vs noisy environment)
3. **Different microphone distance/position**
4. **Different audio processing path**
5. **Different speaking style** (careful recording vs natural speech)

## Immediate Solutions

### Quick Test: Lower Threshold Temporarily
```bash
# Edit .env
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.35

# Restart and test
# This will capture more segments (including 0.35-0.50 range)
# Check if you get more transcripts
# If yes: confirms profile issue
# If still missing: different problem
```

### Permanent Solution: Re-create Profile

**Critical:** Record profile using **EXACT SAME setup** as live monitoring:

1. Use "Record from Microphone" (not upload!)
2. Same MacBook Pro Microphone
3. Same location
4. Same distance from mic (~30-50cm, normal laptop use)
5. Similar background noise level
6. 45-60 seconds of natural speech
7. Vary tone and volume
8. Check quality ≥ 0.75

See: `docs/PROFILE_RECREATION_GUIDE.md`

## Expected After Fix

With good profile match:
```
TARGET similarity: 0.75-0.92
Target detected: 40-50% of chunks
Transcribed: 40-50% of chunks
Avg similarity: 0.82
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test with lower threshold (0.35)** - see if you get more transcripts
2. **If yes:** Re-create profile for better match
3. **If no:** Check microphone, audio device, system settings

**Status:** Diagnosis complete, action required (profile re-creation)
