# GitHub Configuration

This directory contains GitHub-specific configuration files for the project.

## Files

### `copilot-instructions.md`

**Purpose**: Provides context and instructions to GitHub Copilot for code generation.

**How it works**:
- GitHub Copilot **automatically reads** this file when working in this repository
- It uses the instructions to provide better, project-specific code suggestions
- The file should be updated as the project evolves

**When to update**:
- ‚úÖ After completing major implementation phases
- ‚úÖ When architecture decisions change
- ‚úÖ When adding new technologies or patterns
- ‚úÖ When common issues/solutions are discovered
- ‚úÖ After learning what works/doesn't work

**Usage**:
- Copilot reads this automatically - no action needed
- Reference it explicitly: `@.github/copilot-instructions.md implement the DiarizationService`
- Keep it focused on **implementation** details, not design discussions

**Current Status**: 
- üìù Initial version created
- üéØ Ready for Phase 1 implementation (Core Services)
